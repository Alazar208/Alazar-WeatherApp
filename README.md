# Weather Search Application

## Overview

The **Weather Search Application** is a lightweight web application that allows users to fetch real-time weather data for any city or ZIP code. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API and is built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS** for the backend and templating engine. The project adheres to the guidelines provided for the wireless and mobile network programming option.

## Features

- Real-time weather updates for any city or ZIP code.
- Displays detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- Sunrise and sunset times are presented in a user-friendly format.
- Adaptive background based on weather conditions (e.g., clear skies, rain, snow).

## Objectives

1. **Deepen Understanding of Wireless and Mobile Networking**  
   By interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API, the project validates theoretical knowledge through practical implementation.

2. **Hands-on Coding Practice**  
   Implemented using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, the project enhances coding skills and familiarity with RESTful APIs.

3. **Scientific Writing and Presentation Skills**  
   Includes a detailed report and in-class presentation following the prescribed formatting and clarity guidelines.
